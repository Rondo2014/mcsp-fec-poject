# MCSP FEC Project

Welcome to the MCSP FEC Project repository, where we are building a Steam storefront clone. The project consists of a frontend application located in the `client` folder and a backend server located in the `server` folder. The frontend is built using Vite, Tailwind CSS, React, Axios, and React DOM Router, along with the official Steam API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Clone the Repository

To clone the repository to your local machine, use the following command: ```git clone https://github.com/Rondo2014/mcsp-fec-project.git```


### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project's root directory and install the dependencies by running the following command: ```npm install```

This will run a script to install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend AND backend. You only need to run this command once.

### Run the Application

To start both the backend server and the development server for the frontend, run the following command from the project's root directory: ```npm run dev```


This command will concurrently run the development servers for both the frontend and backend.

Alternatively, if you want to run only the frontend or backend server separately, you can navigate to the respective directories (`client` or `server`) and run the following command: ```npm run dev```


This will start the development server for either the frontend or backend individually.

### Theming

The Steam colors used in the MCSP FEC Project are set up as a theme in the Tailwind CSS configuration file. You can customize the theme by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file located in the project's `client` folder. Make sure to rebuild the project after making any changes to the theme configuration.

## Contributing

Contributions to the MCSP FEC Project are limited to the core development team.
